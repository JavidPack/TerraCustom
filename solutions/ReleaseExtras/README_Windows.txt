Install Instructions: Make a 'TerraCustom' folder next to the Terraria install folder and place the .zip contents in it.

To Run: Run TerraCustom.exe

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Terraria"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder. If you can't find it, view this video: https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantAssuredIsabellineshrike

  GOG: Wherever you put it, likely "C:\GOG Games\Terraria​"

Note: "C:\Documents\My Games\Terraria\" is NOT your install folder, it is your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed in the install folder to work.
